            <p id="desc">Hello, my name is Tharun and I hail from India. I am currently in the midst of applying for undergraduate admissions and as a part of my application, I had intended to submit a portfolio of my work. Unfortunately, I missed the deadline and the portals were closed. However, I refused to let this setback discourage me and instead, I took the initiative to create my own website to showcase my portfolio. I have included several of my projects and works on this site.</p>

            <p id="desc_small">As you may know, I took a gap year after my grandfatherâ€™s death to pursue my personal and academic interests. During this time, I was able to work on several projects that allowed me to develop my skills and showcase my abilities. I am proud to say that I have uploaded video previews of these projects in my portfolio section for your reference.<br></p>
            <p id="desc_small">My gap year has not only allowed me to develop my skills, but it has also provided me with a clearer picture of my future goals. My ambition is to become an entrepreneur and I am confident that I have the talent and determination to achieve this goal.<br></p>
            <p id="desc_small">One of my primary goals is to create a productive website that will allow users to save and retrieve their details at any time and from any place. Another ambitious goal of mine is to create a gaming universe like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), where there is an interlink between games. I believe that these projects have the potential to change the world and make a positive impact on people's lives.<br></p>
            <p id="desc_small">However, I recognize that I need a place where I can grow even more and develop the skills necessary to succeed in this competitive field.<br></p>
            <p id="desc_small">I am excited to join the student community at your institution and I am confident that I will make the most of this opportunity to grow both personally and professionally. I believe that your institution can provide me with the resources and support I need to turn my ambitions into reality.<br></p>
            <p id="desc_small">Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to hear your thoughts and I look forward to the opportunity to meet you in person.<br></p>
